# Desktop-Tool-Windows-Python-Tkinter
GUI Application made with Python & Tkinter - allows to see date/time, read out hardware info, start apps and more
(The program uses standard Tkinter, no customtkinter or similar)

The images (colored rects and circles + laptop image) are placeholders (copyright reasons). The original version would use matching icons and a different laptop image.

Keep in mind that there could be shifts in the widgets or general layout problems when the GUI is started.
